## 7. Disguised Suicides

### 7.1 Common Methods of Disguised Suicides

Disguised suicide is one of the common crime methods in the "Detective Conan" series, with the core characteristic being that criminals disguise murders as suicides to mislead the investigation direction of detectives and police. This method not only conceals the true criminal facts but also provides the culprit with more time and possibilities to escape.

In the "Detective Conan" series, the main implementation methods of disguised suicides include:

First is fabricating suicide scenes. After killing the victim, the culprit carefully arranges the scene to make it look like a suicide scene. This includes placing "suicide tools" (such as knives, ropes, drugs, etc.) near or beside the victim, creating the illusion that the victim used these tools to commit suicide; adjusting the victim's posture to match typical characteristics of suicide; cleaning traces at the scene that might expose the murder fact, such as signs of struggle, fingerprints, or DNA left by the culprit.

Second is fabricating suicide motives. The culprit may create or emphasize the victim's suicide motives in advance, such as spreading information that the victim was facing economic difficulties, emotional setbacks, work pressure, or health problems, making people more likely to accept the possibility of the victim's suicide. Sometimes, the culprit even forges suicide notes, directly "proving" the victim's suicidal intention.

Third is using special tools or techniques. Some culprits use special tools or techniques to make murders more easily mistaken for suicides. For example, using special weapons that can be removed after killing; using knives made of ice that will melt and disappear after completing the murder; or using special techniques that can simulate suicide wound characteristics.

In addition, there is taking advantage of the victim's special state. For example, choosing to commit crimes when the victim is drunk, medicated, or asleep, making the victim unable to resist, reducing signs of struggle; or taking advantage of the victim's special psychological state, such as depression patients, making suicide seem more reasonable.

The advantage of disguised suicide is that if successful, the case may be directly determined as suicide and closed, allowing the culprit to completely escape legal sanctions; even if suspicions are raised, the initial direction of the investigation will be misled, giving the culprit more time. In addition, even if it is finally determined to be murder, proving that a specific suspect is the culprit will also be more difficult.

However, disguised suicide also has some inherent risks and limitations. First, suicide scenes usually have some typical characteristics, and if the culprit does not know enough about these characteristics, it is easy to leave traces that do not match suicide characteristics. Second, forensic examination may find wound characteristics that do not match suicide, such as wound angle, force, or number. Third, the victim's life state and psychological state may not match suicide, raising suspicions. Finally, the culprit may leave their own traces when arranging the scene, providing clues for detectives.

In the "Detective Conan" series, solving disguised suicide cases usually requires detectives to have keen observation and rich forensic knowledge, able to discover inconsistencies at the scene and identify the true cause and manner of death. Conan and other detective characters usually reveal the murder truth behind disguised suicides by analyzing wound characteristics, scene traces, the victim's life and psychological state, etc.

### 7.2 Classic Disguised Suicide Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic disguised suicide cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Idol's Locked Room Murder**

Case Background: An idol singer was found dead in their own room, the cause of death being a knife piercing the neck. The room was a locked room, with all doors and windows locked from the inside. The scene seemed to be a suicide case, but Conan suspected things weren't that simple.

Crime Method: The culprit used a knife made of ice. Specifically, the culprit made an ice knife in advance, and after killing the victim, left the ice knife at the scene. As time passed, the ice knife melted, leaving only an ordinary knife handle and the victim's wound. Since the murder weapon (the ice knife had melted) was not found, and the room was a locked room, the police initially determined it to be suicide.

Key Clues: Water stain traces at the scene, and wound characteristics that did not match ordinary suicide.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the possibility of the culprit using an ice knife by analyzing the water stains at the scene and wound characteristics. This case demonstrates how to use special materials (ice) to make disappearing murder weapons, making murder seem like suicide.

**Case Two: The Luxury Cruise Ship Serial Murders**

Case Background: On a luxury cruise ship, an old man was found dead in his own room, the cause of death being stabbed by a knife. The doors and windows of the room were locked, there were bloodstains on the door frame, and no murder weapon was found in the room. It was initially judged to be suicide, but some details raised Conan's suspicions.

Crime Method: This was a locked room case of disguised suicide. After killing the victim, the culprit used the assumption of the victim's last bit of strength to create a locked room. Specifically, the culprit killed the victim with the door open, then left the room. The victim used their last strength before dying to close the door, making the room a locked room. Since no murder weapon was found in the room, and the door was locked from the inside, it initially appeared to be suicide.

Key Clues: Bloodstains on the door frame, indicating that the victim had contact with the door after being injured; no murder weapon was found in the room, which did not match suicide characteristics.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced that the victim may have closed the door after being injured, rather than committing suicide, by analyzing the bloodstains on the door frame and other traces at the scene. This case demonstrates how to use the victim's behavior before death to create a locked room of disguised suicide.

**Case Three: The Colorful Legend's Mansion in Water**

Case Background: In a mansion in water, the victim was found hanging from the room's crossbeam, the cause of death being strangulation by a rope. The doors and windows of the room were locked from the inside, seemingly a suicide case.

Crime Method: The culprit used a mechanism of ropes and a water wheel. Specifically, the culprit first killed the victim, then used the mechanism of ropes and a water wheel to hang the corpse, creating a suicide scene. The rope break was obviously cut by someone first and then worn off, there was sawdust on the scroll, and there were also friction marks near where the hanging rope was on the beam, all indicating that the corpse was dragged up by a rope, rather than suicide.

Key Clues: The characteristics of the rope break, friction marks on the beam, and rope marks on the water wheel.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the possibility of the culprit using a mechanism to hang the victim by analyzing these traces, revealing the truth of the disguised suicide. This case demonstrates how to use mechanical devices (water wheel) to create a scene of disguised suicide.

**Case Four: The Sigh of the Tide**

Case Background: A man was found dead from falling from a height, initially judged to be suicide. However, some details raised Conan's suspicions.

Crime Method: The culprit disguised murder as suicide. Specifically, the culprit may have pushed the victim from a height when they were off guard, or killed the victim first, then threw the corpse from a height, creating the illusion of suicide. The culprit may have also fabricated suicide motives, such as spreading rumors that the victim was facing economic difficulties or relationship problems.

Key Clues: The posture and position of the victim's fall, possible signs of struggle, and whether the victim's life state matched the suicide motive.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced that the victim may have been murdered rather than committed suicide by analyzing the fall traces and the victim's life state. This case demonstrates how to use falling from a height, a common method of suicide, to cover up murder facts.

These classic disguised suicide cases showcase the diversity and innovation of disguised suicide methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of forensic knowledge and detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of disguised suicides and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
