## 5. Fabricated Alibis

### 5.1 Time-Based Alibis

Time-based alibis are one of the common crime methods in the "Detective Conan" series, with the core characteristic being that criminals manipulate time perception or death time determination to create the illusion that they were not at the scene at the time of the crime. This type of method mainly targets cases where bodies are discovered later, misleading the detective's investigation direction by affecting the forensic doctor's judgment of the time of death or by creating alibis for specific time points.

In time-based alibis, common methods include:

First is manipulating the degree of rigor mortis or the rate of body temperature decrease. For example, in "The Kogoro Mouri Class Reunion Murder Case," the culprit accelerated the degree of rigor mortis by exercising vigorously before passing out, creating the illusion that the time of death was earlier than it actually was. Specifically, after killing the victim, the culprit engaged in intense exercise, causing a large amount of lactic acid to be produced in their muscles, then took drugs to make themselves unconscious. When they woke up, the degree of muscle stiffness was similar to that of the deceased, creating the illusion that both died at the same time, when in fact the culprit "died" after committing the murder.

Second is using special environmental conditions to affect corpse changes. For example, placing the corpse in a special temperature environment (such as a refrigerator, heated room, etc.), or using chemicals to treat the corpse, changing the natural process of corpse changes, causing errors in the forensic doctor's judgment of the time of death.

Third is creating proof of existence at a specific time point. For example, pre-recording sounds or images and playing them at the time of the crime, making others believe that the culprit was in another place at the time of the crime; or using phone forwarding, timed sending of emails or text messages, and other technologies to create the illusion that they were still in a place after they had already left.

Solving time-based alibis usually requires careful analysis of unnatural aspects of the corpse's state, or finding loopholes in the culprit's time proof. In the Conan series, these cases are usually solved by discovering contradictions between the corpse's state and the estimated time of death, or by proving that the culprit's time proof may have been fabricated.

### 5.2 Location-Based Alibis

Location-based alibis are another common crime method, with the core characteristic being that criminals create the illusion that they could not have committed the crime by proving they were in a place other than the crime scene. This type of method mainly targets cases with clear crime scenes, misleading the detective's investigation direction by creating evidence that they were far from the crime scene.

In location-based alibis, common methods include:

First is using others as witnesses. For example, in "The Red Leaf Village Fire Festival Murder Case," the culprit may arrange for friends, relatives, or accomplices to testify for them at the time of the crime, proving they were elsewhere. The key to this method is the reliability of the witnesses and the consistency of their testimonies.

Second is using physical evidence. For example, leaving fingerprints, DNA, or other personal items in a place far from the crime scene, or appearing in front of surveillance cameras, creating evidence that they were not at the scene at the time of the crime.

Third is using transportation time differences. For example, proving that they were in a place far from the crime scene at time points before and after the crime, making people believe that it was impossible to travel to and from the crime scene in the limited time, thereby creating an alibi.

The characteristic of location-based alibis is that they mainly target cases that are witnessed, that is, cases where someone witnessed the incident or discovered the corpse. The culprit creates evidence that they were elsewhere at the time of the crime, causing people to question: "Because it's XXX, but he was chatting with us at the time of the crime, or he was at XXX, what's going on?"

Solving location-based alibis usually requires questioning the reliability of witness testimonies, or proving that the culprit could possibly travel to and from the crime scene in a short time. In the Conan series, these cases are usually solved by finding contradictions in witness testimonies, or discovering secret passages or fast transportation tools that the culprit may have used.

### 5.3 Self or Testimony-Based Alibis

Self or testimony-based alibis are a more complex crime method, with the core characteristic being that criminals create the illusion that they could not have committed the crime by changing their appearance, behavior, or using others' testimonies. This type of method is most widely applied in the Conan series, involving various innovative and clever techniques.

In self or testimony-based alibis, common methods include:

First is using mechanisms to create dummies. For example, in "The Strange Person in Front of the Emperor Murder Case," the culprit may use mechanical devices or special materials to make a dummy similar to themselves, place it in a specific position, making others believe that what they saw was themselves, thereby creating an alibi.

Second is using internal crime scenes. For example, in "The Distorted Prosecution," the culprit used the position of the gun to pretend they were not at the scene at the time of the crime. Specifically, the culprit may use special mechanisms or devices to make the weapon fire or move in their absence, creating the illusion that they were not at the scene.

Third is using others' misunderstandings or preconceived notions. For example, using people's conventional understanding of time, space, or causal relationships to create seemingly reasonable but actually false alibis.

In addition, there is a special type of self-based alibi, which is using one's special physique or state. For example, the culprit may disguise themselves as being seriously injured or disabled, making people believe they did not have the ability to commit the crime; or using special drugs or techniques to temporarily change their appearance or behavior, making it impossible for people to connect them with the crime.

Solving self or testimony-based alibis usually requires careful observation of unnatural aspects of the culprit's behavior or state, or finding logical contradictions in testimonies. In the Conan series, these cases are usually solved by discovering subtle flaws in the culprit's disguise or mechanism, or by proving through logical reasoning that the culprit's alibi could possibly be fabricated.

### 5.4 Classic Alibi Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic fabricated alibi cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Kogoro Mouri Class Reunion Murder Case**

Case Background: At Kogoro Mouri's class reunion, one participant was killed. The culprit had an alibi at the time of the crime because they were found unconscious, with stiff muscles, seemingly dying at the same time as the victim.

Crime Method: The culprit used a time-based alibi. Specifically, after killing the victim, the culprit engaged in intense exercise, causing a large amount of lactic acid to be produced in their muscles, then took drugs to make themselves unconscious. When they were found, the degree of muscle stiffness was similar to that of the deceased, making people believe that both died at the same time, when in fact the culprit "died" after committing the murder.

Key Clues: The unnatural degree of the culprit's muscle stiffness, and possible traces of drugs or physiological reactions after exercise.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced how the culprit created a time-based alibi by analyzing the unnatural aspects of the culprit's physical state and considering the special situation of muscle stiffness after intense exercise. This case demonstrates how to use physiological knowledge to create a seemingly reliable alibi.

**Case Two: The Red Leaf Village Fire Festival Murder Case**

Case Background: During the fire festival in Red Leaf Village, a villager was killed. The culprit had an alibi at the time of the crime because multiple people confirmed they were at the festival, while the crime scene was far from the festival.

Crime Method: The culprit used a location-based alibi. Specifically, the culprit may have arranged for an accomplice to impersonate them at the festival, or used the chaos in the crowd and similar clothing to make people believe that what they saw was themselves. At the same time, the culprit secretly left the festival, went to the crime scene to commit the crime, and then quickly returned to the festival.

Key Clues: The degree of chaos at the festival, the culprit's possible departure time and route, and possible accomplices or similarly dressed people.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan revealed the loophole in the location-based alibi by analyzing the personnel flow and time arrangement at the festival, discovering that the culprit could possibly leave the festival, commit the crime, and then return in a short time. This case demonstrates how to use crowd chaos and time differences to create a seemingly reliable alibi.

**Case Three: The Strange Person in Front of the Emperor Murder Case**

Case Background: In an ancient mansion, the owner was killed. The culprit had an alibi at the time of the crime because they were seen by multiple people in another room of the mansion.

Crime Method: The culprit used a self-based alibi. Specifically, the culprit made a dummy similar to themselves, placed it in a certain room of the mansion, making others believe that what they saw was themselves. At the same time, the culprit secretly went to the crime scene to commit the crime, then returned and retrieved the dummy.

Key Clues: The materials and techniques used to make the dummy, and the culprit's possible movement route and time.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the possibility that the culprit used a dummy to create an alibi by discovering that some witnesses' descriptions of the culprit's behavior were unnatural, or by discovering possible subtle flaws in the dummy. This case demonstrates how to use dummies or mechanisms to create a seemingly reliable alibi.

**Case Four: The Distorted Prosecution**

Case Background: A prosecutor was shot in their office. The culprit had an alibi at the time of the crime because they were confirmed to be elsewhere.

Crime Method: The culprit used an internal crime scene-based alibi. Specifically, the culprit set up a gun device in the office in advance that could be remotely controlled or timed to fire, making the gun fire in their absence, killing the victim.

Key Clues: The special installation position of the gun and possible remote control devices, and the culprit's possible advance preparation work.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced how the culprit implemented the shooting in their absence by analyzing the angle and force of the shooting, as well as possible mechanism traces in the office. This case demonstrates how to use mechanisms and remote control to create a seemingly reliable alibi.

These classic alibi cases showcase the diversity and innovation of fabricated alibi methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of fabricated alibis and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
