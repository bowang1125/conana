Third, revenge-type criminals may be more willing to take risks or sacrifice themselves as long as they can complete their revenge. This makes them likely to choose bolder or more extreme crime methods, even if this increases the risk of being discovered or caught. For example, in "The New York Case," the criminal planned a series of eye-catching bombing events to avenge the murderer who killed his family, although this high-profile crime method increased the risk of being caught.

**The Connection Between Interest Motive and Crime Method**

Crimes with interest motives are usually more rational and calculated, which is also reflected in the choice of crime method.

First, interest-type criminals often choose crime methods with lower risk but certain effect. For example, in cases involving inheritance, criminals may choose to use poisons that are difficult to detect, or carefully plan deaths that seem accidental, to reduce the possibility of being suspected.

Second, interest-type criminals usually invest more time and resources in planning crimes and covering up evidence. This may lead to more complex and sophisticated crime methods, such as carefully designed locked room murders, complex alibis, or detailed crime scene processing. For example, in "The Tower in the Snow" case, the criminal carefully planned a seemingly accidental death to obtain a huge insurance payout, including complex time manipulation and scene arrangement.

Third, interest-type criminals may be more inclined to choose crime methods that can be disguised as natural death, accident, or suicide, to avoid triggering murder investigations. For example, using certain poisons that may cause heart attacks, or planning seemingly accidental falls or drownings.

**The Connection Between Fear and Self-Preservation Motive and Crime Method**

Crimes with fear and self-preservation motives usually have urgency and defensiveness, which influences the characteristics of the crime method.

First, fear-type criminals may choose relatively simple and direct crime methods due to time constraints or insufficient preparation. For example, in silencing cases, criminals may use readily available tools or weapons, such as kitchen knives, ropes, etc., rather than carefully prepared special tools.

Second, fear-type criminals may be more likely to have oversights or leave evidence during the crime process because their actions are often influenced by fear and pressure, making it difficult to remain calm and thorough. This may lead to loopholes or inconsistencies in the crime method, providing clues for detectives.

Third, fear-type criminals may be more inclined to choose crime methods that can quickly and effectively eliminate threats, rather than considering long-term cover-up effects. For example, in "The Shadow of the Black Organization," a witness who knew too many secrets was quickly executed by an organization member. Although this direct method increased the risk of being discovered, it could immediately eliminate the threat.

**The Connection Between Jealousy and Possession Motive and Crime Method**

Crimes with jealousy and possession motives usually carry strong emotional colors, which is also reflected in the crime method.

First, jealousy-type criminals may choose crime methods with symbolic destruction, especially targeting features or relationships that cause jealousy. For example, choosing to disfigure someone due to jealousy of their beauty, or choosing to commit crimes at places where lovers meet due to jealousy of someone's romantic relationship.

Second, jealousy-type criminals may be more inclined to choose crime methods that allow direct confrontation with the victim, rather than long-distance or indirect methods. This reflects the criminal's psychological need for the victim to know their identity and motive. For example, in "The Dance Under the Moon" case, the criminal chose to personally poison the rival at the dance, rather than using a safer but indirect method.

Third, jealousy-type criminals may show more emotional fluctuations and irrational behavior during the crime process, which may lead to excessive violence or "passion" characteristics in the crime method. For example, excessive number of stab wounds, unnecessary destructive behavior, etc.

**The Connection Between Ideology and Belief Motive and Crime Method**

Crimes with ideology and belief motives usually have strong symbolism and sense of mission, which directly influences the crime method.

First, ideology-type criminals often choose crime methods that can convey specific information or symbolic meaning. For example, environmental extremists may choose specific methods targeting polluting enterprises, or religious fanatics may choose ritual methods related to their beliefs.

Second, ideology-type criminals may be more inclined to choose high-profile crime methods that can attract pub<response clipped><NOTE>To save on context only part of this file has been shown to you.
