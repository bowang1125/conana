## 6. Timed Murders

### 6.1 Principles of Timed Murders

Timed murder is a highly technical and planned crime method in the "Detective Conan" series, with the core characteristic being that criminals set up killing devices in advance, making them automatically execute at specific times, so that they may have already left the scene or have alibis when the crime occurs. This method not only provides the culprit with a perfect alibi but also increases the mystery and complexity of the case.

The basic principle of timed murder is to separate the killing action from the culprit's direct operation in time through some mechanism. This mechanism can be a mechanical device, chemical reaction, electronic device, or natural phenomenon, as long as it can trigger the killing action at a predetermined time.

In the "Detective Conan" series, the main implementation methods of timed murders include:

First are mechanical timing devices. These devices usually use clocks, timers, or other mechanical mechanisms to trigger killing actions at specific times. For example, connecting firearms to clock mechanisms to make them automatically fire at specific times; or setting up a mechanism to release poison gas or activate other lethal devices at specific times.

Second is chemical reaction timing. This method uses the time characteristics of chemical reactions to make poisons or explosives take effect after a specific time. For example, using slowly dissolving substances as isolation layers, when they completely dissolve, two chemicals come into contact to produce poison gas or explosions; or using the reaction time of certain chemicals under specific conditions to create timing effects.

Third are electronic timing devices. These devices use electronic timers or remote control devices to trigger killing actions at specific times. For example, using mobile phones or computer programs to control explosive devices that automatically activate at preset times; or using electronic locking systems to unlock or lock certain mechanisms at specific times.

In addition, there are timing methods that use natural phenomena. These methods use the regularity of natural phenomena, such as tides, sunrise and sunset, temperature changes, etc., as triggering conditions. For example, using tidal rises and falls to activate certain mechanisms; or using temperature changes to melt ice, triggering subsequent mechanisms.

The advantage of timed murder is that the culprit can be far from the scene when the crime occurs, creating a perfect alibi. At the same time, due to the complexity and concealment of the killing device, it is often difficult to be discovered and disarmed in time, increasing the possibility of successful crime.

However, timed murder also has some inherent risks and limitations. First, timing devices may fail for various reasons, such as mechanical failures, electronic failures, or environmental changes. Second, timing devices need to be installed in advance, which increases the risk of being discovered. Third, timed murder usually requires precise calculations and preparations, demanding higher technical and planning abilities from the culprit. Finally, timing devices often leave traces, providing clues for detectives to solve the case.

In the "Detective Conan" series, solving timed murder cases usually requires detectives to have keen observation and rich scientific knowledge, able to discover abnormalities at the scene and deduce the existence and working principles of timing devices. Conan and other detective characters usually reveal the mechanism of timed murder and the identity of the culprit by analyzing physical traces, chemical reactions, or electronic devices at the scene.

### 6.2 Classic Timed Murder Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic timed murder cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Holmes Enthusiast Murder Case**

Case Background: In a villa isolated from the outside world, a Holmes enthusiast was found dead. The victim suddenly collapsed in front of everyone, and the culprit seemed to have no opportunity to approach the victim at the time of the incident.

Crime Method: The culprit used a chemical timed murder method. Specifically, the culprit applied a special poison in advance to items frequently used by the victim (such as pipes, books, etc.). This poison needed to oxidize for a certain time or come into contact with specific substances before releasing its toxicity. When the victim used these items at a specific time, the poison was activated, causing death by poisoning.

Key Clues: Possible chemical traces on items used by the victim, and abnormal behaviors or symptoms of the victim before death.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan discovered the existence and activation mechanism of the poison by analyzing the victim's behavior and symptoms before death, as well as examining the items used by the victim. This case demonstrates how to use the time characteristics of chemical reactions to create timed murder effects.

**Case Two: The Financial Company President Murder Case**

Case Background: A financial company president was found dead in his office, the cause of death being poisoning. The culprit had a perfect alibi at the time of the incident, seemingly impossible to commit the crime.

Crime Method: The culprit used a heat-activated poison. Specifically, the culprit applied a special poison to the gas stove frequently used by the victim. This poison was non-toxic at room temperature but would release deadly gas at high temperatures. When the victim used the gas stove to boil water, the poison was heated, releasing poison gas, causing death by poisoning.

Key Clues: Possible chemical traces on the gas stove, and the environmental conditions when the victim died (such as whether the gas stove was being used).

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced that the victim may have been poisoned while using the gas stove by observing the scene environment and the victim's daily habits. Further examination of the gas stove revealed traces of poison, revealing the mechanism of timed murder. This case demonstrates how to use heat activation mechanisms to create timed murder effects.

**Case Three: Dracula's Villa Murder Case**

Case Background: In a villa isolated from the outside world, the owner was found dead in his study late at night. The culprit had an alibi at the time of the incident because he was confirmed to be in another room of the villa.

Crime Method: The culprit used a mechanical timing device. Specifically, the culprit used a film projector and tape to make a timing device. He connected the killing mechanism to the projector, setting it to activate at a specific time (when playing to a specific segment). When the projector automatically started late at night and played to the specific segment, the killing mechanism was triggered, causing the victim's death.

Key Clues: Abnormal settings of the projector, and possible connection traces of the mechanism.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan discovered the existence and working principle of the mechanism by examining the projector and the surrounding environment. This case demonstrates how to use mechanical devices to create timed murder effects while providing the culprit with a perfect alibi.

**Case Four: The Key in Water Locked Room Case**

Case Background: An architecture student was found having committed suicide in the bathroom, the scene was a locked room with only a small ventilation window open. A key was floating on the water surface of a model in the room, and the door lock and windows were locked from the inside.

Crime Method: Although this case is mainly a locked room case, it also involves timing elements. The culprit used a biological timing mechanism. Specifically, the culprit used the behavioral characteristics of beetles, tying the key to a beetle, using the scent of female beetles to attract male beetles into the room. When the beetle crawled onto the water surface, the key naturally fell into the water. Then, the culprit used a mosquito lamp outside the ventilation window to attract the beetle to leave the scene.

Key Clues: Possible traces of beetles in the room, and how the key could move to the water surface without anyone present.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the possibility of using beetles as carriers by analyzing the position of the key and possible ways it could move. This case demonstrates how to use biological behavior to create timing effects, while combining locked room elements to increase the complexity of the case.

These classic timed murder cases showcase the diversity and innovation of timed murder methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of scientific knowledge and detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of timed murders and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
