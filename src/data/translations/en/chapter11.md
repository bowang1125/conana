### 11.1 Characteristics of Serial Killings

Serial killing is a type of crime in the "Detective Conan" series that is extremely shocking and complex, referring to the behavior of criminals who plan to kill multiple victims consecutively. This type of crime is different from general single murder cases, having a series of unique characteristics and patterns, making it an extremely challenging puzzle in detective stories.

Serial killings in the Conan series usually have the following notable characteristics:

First is planning and continuity. Serial killers usually carefully plan each murder and implement them consecutively according to specific time intervals or conditions. This continuity may manifest as fixed time intervals (such as once a month), specific dates (such as special anniversaries), or when specific conditions are met (such as when specific people appear). This planning and continuity make serial killing cases somewhat predictable, while also reflecting the criminal's calmness and patience.

Second is the pattern of selecting victims. Serial killers often select victims according to some specific standard or pattern, which may be based on the victim's appearance characteristics (such as hair color, age, gender), occupational background, social relationships, or specific connections with the criminal. This selection pattern is usually closely related to the criminal's motivation, psychological state, or personal experience, and is an important clue for solving the case.

Third is the consistency or evolution of the crime method. Serial killers may use the same or similar crime methods (such as the same weapon, the same killing method, or the same time of crime), forming a so-called "crime signature." This consistency helps the police connect multiple cases. But some serial killers will also gradually change or perfect their crime methods as the cases progress, showing a kind of evolution, which increases the difficulty of solving the case.

In addition, serial killers often leave specific marks or information. These marks may be physical (such as specific items placed beside the victim), symbolic (such as specific symbols or patterns), or informational (such as notes or messages left). These marks may be challenges issued by the criminal to the police or society, ways of expressing specific emotions or thoughts, or part of the crime ritual.

The complexity of psychological motivation is also an important characteristic of serial killing cases. Compared with general murder cases, the motivations of serial killers are often more complex and deep, possibly involving psychological trauma, revenge psychology, desire for power control, abnormal psychology, or specific ideologies. Understanding these psychological motivations is crucial for predicting the criminal's next move and ultimately solving the case.

In the Conan series, serial killing cases usually also have an important characteristic: hidden logic or theme. These cases may seem random or unrelated on the surface, but in reality, they often hide some logical relationship or theme, such as killing in a specific order, imitating plots from a historical event or literary work, or following some symbolic system. Discovering this hidden logic or theme is usually the key to solving the case.

Finally, serial killing cases usually cause social panic and media attention. In the Conan series, these cases often become social focal points, causing widespread discussion and panic, increasing the pressure on the police and detectives, while also possibly affecting the behavioral patterns of the criminal.

When solving serial killing cases, detectives usually need to adopt the following methods:

One is to establish connections between cases. By analyzing the commonalities and differences between different cases, confirm whether they are committed by the same criminal, and try to understand the criminal's selection pattern and behavioral logic.

Two is to analyze the crime scene and evidence. Serial killers may leave similar evidence or traces in different cases. By analyzing these pieces of evidence in detail, the criminal's behavioral profile and characteristics can be established.

Three is to predict the next crime. Based on the analysis of existing cases and understanding of the criminal's psychology, try to predict the next possible victim or crime location, so as to take preventive measures or set traps in advance.

Four is to understand the criminal's psychological motivation. Deeply analyze the criminal's possible psychological state and motivation, which helps narrow down the range of suspects and predict their behavior.

Five is to utilize media and public power. When appropriate, release information through the media, seek public assistance, or send specific information to the criminal, influencing their behavior or guiding them to expose themselves.

In the Conan series, serial killing cases are usually one of the most complex and thrilling types of cases. They not only test the detective's reasoning ability and observation, but also deeply explore the dark side of human nature and social problems, providing readers and viewers with a rich space for thought.

### 11.2 Classic Serial Killing Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are multiple classic serial killing cases. Below is a detailed analysis of several representative cases.

**Case One: "The Love Story of the Metropolitan Police Department's Detective" (Serial Robbery and Murder Case)**

This case is one of the famous serial killing cases in the Conan series, involving a series of seemingly random but actually specifically targeted murder events.

Case Background: A series of robbery and murder cases occurred in the Tokyo area. The victims were all young women living alone. The manner of death was similar, all being strangled to death, and their residences were completely ransacked. The police initially believed this was an ordinary serial robbery and murder case, but as the investigation deepened, they discovered a more complex truth.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal used the identity of a delivery person to approach the victims, gain trust, and then enter their residences to commit crimes. Each crime followed a similar pattern: first confirming that the victim lived alone, then approaching under the pretext of delivery, entering the residence to commit murder and robbery. The criminal carefully selected victims, ensuring that each victim met specific conditions, and maintained consistency in the time and method of the crime, forming an obvious "crime signature."

Key Clues: Detective Sato discovered that all victims were related to a specific police academy graduation photo, suggesting that the criminal might be targeting a specific group for revenge. Further investigation revealed that all victims were former girlfriends of a certain police academy student who had committed suicide before graduation.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The key to this case was to discover the hidden connection between the victims and understand the criminal's revenge motivation. Conan and the police confirmed that this was a targeted revenge killing case, not a random robbery and murder, by analyzing the commonalities of the victims. Finally, it was discovered that the criminal was the brother of the student who had committed suicide. He believed that these former girlfriends' betrayal had led to his brother's suicide, so he carried out a series of revenge killings.

**Case Two: "The New York Case" (Serial Bombing Case)**

This case occurred in New York, involving a series of carefully planned bombing incidents, a cross-border serial killing case.

Case Background: Multiple explosion incidents occurred consecutively in New York City, targeting specific buildings and public places. Before each explosion, the criminal would send a warning letter containing riddles to the police, hinting at the next explosion location. Conan and Kogoro Mouri happened to be traveling in New York and were caught up in this series of events.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal used time bombs to commit crimes. Each bomb was carefully designed with a specific detonation mechanism. The criminal followed specific logic when choosing explosion locations and challenged the police through warning letters in the form of riddles. This method not only demonstrated the criminal's technical ability but also reflected their desire for control and intellectual challenge.

Key Clues: Conan discovered that the choice of explosion locations was not random, but arranged according to a specific pattern on the New York map. At the same time, the riddles in the warning letters were all related to an ancient nursery rhyme, hinting at the criminal's identity and motivation.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The difficulty of this case was to interpret the criminal's riddles and predict the next explosion location. Conan successfully predicted the last target by analyzing the riddles and the pattern of explosion locations, and discovered that the entire case was related to an unsolved murder case from many years ago. The criminal was a family member of the victim of that case, who drew public attention to the old case through this series of explosions and finally revealed the truth.

**Case Three: "The Tower in the Snow" (Serial Disappearance Case)**

This case occurred in a small town covered with snow, involving multiple mysterious disappearances, which was finally discovered to be a carefully planned serial killing case.

Case Background: People continuously disappeared in a remote snow town. All the missing persons were finally found dead in the snow, their bodies completely frozen, cause of death unknown. The local police were at a loss, and Conan and the Junior Detective League were accidentally involved in this case during their travels.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal utilized the extreme weather conditions of the small town to commit crimes, first anesthetizing the victims, then placing them in the snow, causing them to die from low temperatures. This method made the deaths seem like natural causes (hypothermia), concealing the fact of murder. The criminal carefully selected victims, ensuring that each victim had specific commonalities, and utilized the geographical environment and weather conditions of the small town when committing crimes, making the crimes difficult to discover.

Key Clues: Conan noticed that all victims' bodies were found in specific locations, which formed a specific pattern when viewed from above. At the same time, all victims had some connection with an ancient tower in the center of the small town.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The key to this case was to discover the connection between the victims and the special arrangement of the death locations. Conan discovered through investigation that all victims had participated in a decision about the tower, which led to a family tragedy. The criminal was the survivor of that family, who not only carried out revenge but also created a grand "artwork" - the pattern formed by the victims' bodies in the snow - through this series of carefully planned killings.

**Case Four: "The Voice in the Dark" (Singer Consecutive Death Case)**

This case involved the consecutive deaths of multiple popular singers, seemingly accidents or suicides on the surface, but actually a carefully planned serial killing case.

Case Background: Famous singers in the Japanese pop music scene died consecutively, with various causes of death, some seemingly accidents (such as car accidents, drowning), some seemingly suicides. These death events caused widespread public attention and speculation, with some believing it was a "singer's curse." Conan discovered suspicious aspects behind these death events while participating in the recording of a music program.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal used different methods to kill each victim and carefully disguised them as accidents or suicides to avoid arousing police suspicion. Each death event was planned in detail, taking into account the victim's habits, schedule, and environment, ensuring the success of the crime and that it would not be discovered. The criminal also utilized the media and public's superstition about the "curse" to further cover up the criminal facts.

Key Clues: Conan discovered that all the deceased singers had collaborated on an album by the same music producer, and the order of deaths was consistent with the order of songs on the album. Further investigation revealed that a small but specific mark was left at each death scene, which was the criminal's "signature."

Key Points of Solving the Case: The difficulty of this case was to connect multiple seemingly unrelated death events and identify that they were murders rather than accidents or suicides. Conan confirmed that this was a planned serial killing case by analyzing the commonalities of the deceased singers and the special marks at the death scenes. Finally, it was discovered that the criminal was an underappreciated composer on that album, who developed a distorted jealousy and revenge psychology towards successful singers because his talent was ignored.

Through the above case analysis, we can see the common characteristics of serial killing cases in the Conan series: careful planning, specific patterns of victim selection, diversity of crime methods but with consistent "signatures," and complex psychological motivations. The solving of these cases usually requires detectives to have keen observation, strong analytical ability, and a deep understanding of human psychology, able to discover hidden connections and patterns from seemingly unrelated events.

In the "Detective Conan" series, serial killing cases not only provide thrilling reasoning processes but also deeply explore the dark side of human nature, the psychological mechanism of revenge, and the impact of social problems on individual psychology. These cases remind us that beneath the seemingly calm society, there may be hidden deep contradictions and pain, and these problems that have not been properly handled may eventually lead to the occurrence of tragedies.
