## 4. Impossible Crimes

### 4.1 Victim's Impossibility

Victim's impossibility refers to cases in the "Detective Conan" series where corpses appear in seemingly impossible-to-reach places, creating a supernatural or inexplicable criminal phenomenon. The characteristic of this type of crime method is to confuse detectives and readers through the special position of the corpse, making the case appear to be the work of supernatural forces, thereby concealing the true crime method.

In the victim's impossibility type, corpses usually appear in the following special positions:

First are high or difficult-to-reach positions, such as the ceiling beam in "The Mist Goblin" or the top of the "Five-Story Pagoda." In these cases, the culprit usually uses some mechanism or special physical principle to send the corpse to these seemingly impossible-to-reach positions. For example, in "The Mist Goblin" case, the culprit used the buoyancy of water flow to send the corpse to the top of the room, then hung it on the ceiling beam; in the "Five-Story Pagoda" case, the culprit may have used similar mechanisms or rope systems.

Second are open, unshielded areas, such as the open snowy field in "The Magician Murder Case." In these cases, the culprit usually uses environmental conditions or special tools to place the corpse in an open area without leaving traces. For example, in the snow case, the culprit may have used the properties of snow or used tools that could eliminate footprints.

Third are the centers of enclosed or isolated spaces, such as the center of the pool in "The Mystery of the Flowing Stone Pavilion." In these cases, the culprit usually uses water flow, mechanisms, or remote control devices to place the corpse in a seemingly inaccessible position. For example, in the pool case, the culprit may have used underwater passages or special buoyancy devices.

The crime methods of the victim's impossibility type usually focus on the choice of location, with the culprit carefully selecting places that can create visual impact and cognitive confusion. The corpse always appears in the most unlikely place, disrupting the thinking of detectives and readers through first impressions, thereby achieving the purpose of concealing the truth.

However, these crime methods also have their weaknesses. Since the corpse needs to be moved to a special position, many traces are often left, such as dragging marks, mechanism traces, or tool marks. Once all the suspicious points are gathered and imagination is fully utilized, the culprit's method can usually be deduced.

In solving cases of the victim's impossibility type, the key is to think outside the box and consider various possible physical principles and mechanism designs. Detective characters like Conan and Heiji Hattori usually deduce how the culprit placed the corpse in a special position by carefully observing subtle traces at the scene and combining knowledge of physics, chemistry, and other sciences.

### 4.2 Culprit's Impossibility

Culprit's impossibility refers to cases in the "Detective Conan" series where the true culprit hides their identity, making it seem impossible for them to commit the crime, thereby misleading detectives and readers. The characteristic of this type of crime method is to create a mystery about the culprit's identity, causing the investigation to deviate from the truth.

In the culprit's impossibility type, common methods include:

First is identity disguise or substitution. The culprit may disguise themselves as another person's identity, or have others appear in their place on certain occasions, creating the illusion that they cannot possibly be the culprit. For example, in "The Mermaid's Tears Again," the culprit may have used similar appearances or special makeup techniques to make others believe they saw someone else.

Second is using special physiological or medical conditions. The culprit may use their special physique, illness, or disability to make others believe they cannot possibly commit the crime. For example, the culprit may disguise themselves as a disabled person with mobility difficulties, or use special drugs to temporarily change their physiological state.

Third is using illusions of time and space. The culprit may manipulate time perception or spatial cognition to make others believe they were not at the scene at the time of the crime, or that it was impossible to move from one location to another in a short time. For example, the culprit may adjust clocks in advance or use secret passages to move quickly.

The crime methods of the culprit's impossibility type usually require careful planning and preparation, with the culprit considering various possible questions and investigation directions, setting up various obstacles and misdirections in advance. Solving these cases usually requires the detective to have keen observation and logical thinking to discover loopholes in the culprit's disguise or misdirection.

In the "Detective Conan" series, these cases are usually solved by finding inconsistencies in the culprit's disguise or misdirection. For example, the detective may discover subtle flaws in the culprit's disguise, or find logical contradictions in time and space arrangements. Conan and other detective characters usually reveal the culprit's true identity and crime method through careful questioning of witnesses, analysis of scene evidence, and logical reasoning.

### 4.3 Classic Impossible Crime Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic impossible crime cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Magician in the Snow (The Magician Murder Case)**

Case Background: A corpse was found in an open snowy field, with only the victim's own footprints around, and no footprints of anyone else. This seemed to be an impossible crime scene, as the culprit appeared unable to approach the victim without leaving footprints.

Crime Method: The culprit used special tools and the properties of snow. Specifically, the culprit used a long pole or similar tool to stab the victim from a distance, then used the properties of snow to cover their own footprints. Alternatively, the culprit may have worn special shoes that could walk on snow without leaving obvious footprints.

Key Clues: The characteristics of the wounds on the victim's body, and possible tiny traces on the snow, such as marks from dragging tools or unnatural changes in the snow surface.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced how the culprit committed the crime without approaching the victim by analyzing the angle and depth of the wounds, as well as subtle traces on the snow. This case demonstrates how to use environmental conditions (snow) and special tools to create a seemingly impossible crime scene.

**Case Two: The Mermaid's Tears Again**

Case Background: A person disappeared in front of everyone's eyes, then was found dead in another place. Witnesses confirmed that the person was in everyone's sight before disappearing, seemingly with no opportunity to leave or be taken away.

Crime Method: The culprit used identity substitution or similar appearance techniques. Specifically, there may have been a person with a similar appearance to the victim (or the culprit themselves disguised as the victim) appearing in public, while the real victim had already been secretly taken away or killed. When this stand-in "disappeared" at some point, everyone mistakenly believed it was the victim who disappeared, when in fact the victim was no longer at the scene.

Key Clues: Behavioral details of the victim or stand-in, possible inconsistencies or unnatural aspects, and suspicious blanks in the timeline.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the possibility of identity substitution by carefully reviewing the victim's behavior and speech before disappearing, discovering some details that did not match the victim's usual habits. This case demonstrates how to use identity confusion to create seemingly impossible criminal phenomena.

**Case Three: The Legend of the Mysterious Five-Story Pagoda**

Case Background: The victim was found dead at the top of a five-story pagoda, a seemingly inaccessible position. The entrance to the pagoda was locked, with no obvious climbing marks, making it a mystery how the culprit sent the victim to the top of the pagoda.

Crime Method: The culprit may have used special mechanisms or rope systems. Specifically, the culprit may have set up a mechanism inside the pagoda that could send the victim's corpse to the top, or used ropes and pulley systems to control and hoist the corpse to the top from a distance.

Key Clues: Possible mechanism traces on the pagoda, such as rope friction marks, pulley installation marks, or special openings or passages.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced how the culprit sent the victim to the top of the pagoda by examining the structure and surface of the pagoda and discovering some unnatural marks. This case demonstrates how to use mechanisms and physical principles to create a seemingly impossible crime scene.

**Case Four: The Mystery of the Flowing Stone Pavilion**

Case Background: The victim was found floating in the center of an enclosed pool, with no path or tool to approach around. The surface of the pool was calm, with no obvious disturbance marks, making it a mystery how the culprit placed the victim in the center of the pool.

Crime Method: The culprit may have used underwater passages or special buoyancy devices. Specifically, the culprit may have sent the victim into the pool through a secret passage at the bottom of the pool, or used a device that could control buoyancy, making the victim's corpse float to the surface at a specific time and stay in the center of the pool.

Key Clues: Special aspects of the pool structure, such as possible secret passages or water flow control mechanisms, and the state of the victim's corpse, such as whether there were special bindings or attachments.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced how the culprit placed the victim in the center of the pool by analyzing the structure of the pool and the characteristics of the water flow, as well as the state of the victim's corpse. This case demonstrates how to use the properties of water and secret passages to create a seemingly impossible crime scene.

These classic impossible crime cases showcase the diversity and innovation of impossible crime methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of impossible crimes and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
