## 13. Other Special Crime Methods

### 13.1 Special Tools and Mechanisms

In the "Detective Conan" series, besides the main crime methods discussed in previous chapters, there are many unique crime methods that utilize special tools and mechanisms. These methods usually have a high degree of innovation and technicality, demonstrating the wisdom and creativity of criminals, while also providing readers and viewers with a novel reasoning experience.

Special tools play an important role in crimes in the Conan series, and these tools usually have the following characteristics:

First is concealment. Special tools used by criminals are often disguised or modified to make them appear as ordinary items, not easily arousing suspicion. For example, a poison needle launcher disguised as a watch, a lighter modified into a recording device, an umbrella hiding a blade, etc. This concealment allows crime tools to be easily brought to the crime scene and not easily discovered.

Second is multifunctionality. Many special tools are designed to have multiple functions, which can be used both to commit crimes and to cover up evidence or create alibis. For example, in some cases, specially made cameras can not only take photos but also launch poison needles or release smoke. This multifunctionality increases the practicality of the tools while also increasing the difficulty of solving the case.

Third is customization. Criminals usually customize or modify special tools according to the needs of specific crime plans. These customized tools are optimized for specific environments, targets, or situations, making the crime plan more precise and effective. For example, lock-picking tools designed for specific locks, devices suitable for delivering specific poisons, etc.

Common special tools in the Conan series include:

One is modified weapons. This type of tool usually involves modifying ordinary items into weapons with offensive capabilities, such as lighters modified into firearms, canes hiding blades, jewelry containing poison needles, etc. These modified weapons appear harmless but actually possess deadly power.

Two is surveillance and eavesdropping equipment. Criminals often use miniature cameras, bugs, and other equipment to monitor targets or collect intelligence. These devices are usually hidden in ordinary items such as books, vases, clocks, etc., making them difficult to discover.

Three is special chemical substances. Besides common poisons, criminals also use various special chemical substances, such as invisible ink, special developers, timed color-changing chemicals, etc. These substances can be used to transmit secret information, create false evidence, or achieve specific criminal effects.

Four is mechanical devices. Some criminals use precise mechanical devices to commit crimes, such as timers, remote-controlled mechanisms, automatic triggering devices, etc. These devices can perform specific actions when the criminal is not present, providing an alibi for the criminal.

Besides special tools, mechanisms are also common crime elements in the Conan series. Mechanisms usually refer to pre-set devices or systems that can automatically execute specific functions under specific conditions. These mechanisms have the following characteristics:

First is the precision of triggering conditions. Mechanisms are usually designed to trigger when specific conditions are met, such as when a specific time is reached, a specific action is executed, or a specific environmental change occurs. These precise triggering conditions ensure that the mechanism works at the expected time and in the expected situation.

Second is the automaticity of functions. Once the triggering conditions are met, the mechanism will automatically execute the preset function without human intervention. This automaticity allows criminals to complete specific actions when they are not present, creating alibis for themselves.

Third is the concealment of design. Mechanisms are usually cleverly hidden in the environment, not easily discovered. Even if discovered, their true function and triggering method may not be easily understood, increasing the difficulty of deciphering.

Common types of mechanisms in the Conan series include:

One is mechanical mechanisms. This type of mechanism works using mechanical principles such as springs, levers, gears, etc. For example, a hidden door triggered by stepping on a specific floor, a secret room opened by pulling a specific book, a mechanism activated by rotating a specific item, etc. These mechanisms usually have relatively simple structures but clever designs, making them difficult to detect.

Two is electronic mechanisms. With the development of technology, electronic mechanisms are becoming increasingly common in the Conan series. This type of mechanism works using electronic components and circuits, such as timers, sensors, remote controls, etc. For example, timed explosive devices, traps triggered by motion sensors, mechanical devices operated by remote control, etc. Electronic mechanisms usually have more complex functions and more precise control but may also leave more electronic traces.

Three is chemical mechanisms. This type of mechanism works using chemical reactions such as burning, dissolving, oxidation, etc. For example, fires caused by specific chemicals coming into contact with air, poisons dissolved in water, toxic gases released at specific times, etc. Chemical mechanisms usually have delayed effects, and the reaction process may destroy evidence.

Four is composite mechanisms. Many complex crime plans use combinations of multiple types of mechanisms, forming a chain reaction system. For example, a mechanical trigger activates an electronic device, which then initiates a chemical reaction, etc. This type of composite mechanism increases the complexity and reliability of the system while also increasing the difficulty of deciphering.

In the Conan series, the use of special tools and mechanisms not only demonstrates the wisdom and creativity of criminals but also reflects the author's understanding and application of science, technology, and mechanical principles. These elements add a sense of wonder and surprise to the story while also providing rich reasoning clues and puzzle-solving fun.

For detectives, identifying and understanding these special tools and mechanisms is key to solving cases. This requires detectives to have a broad knowledge background, keen observation, and creative thinking, able to discover abnormalities in seemingly ordinary items and deduce possible mechanism principles from seemingly impossible phenomena.

### 13.2 Rare Crime Method Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are multiple classic cases using rare crime methods. Below is a detailed analysis of several representative cases.

**Case One: "The Murder Case on Ghost Face Island" (Mechanism House Trap)**

This case demonstrates how a carefully designed mechanism house can be used as a complex murder trap.

Case Background: A group of people were invited to an ancient mansion on a remote island for a gathering. The owner of the mansion was a famous mechanism designer, and the entire mansion was filled with various mechanisms and traps. As night fell, the guests were killed one after another, each in a different manner but all related to the mechanisms in the mansion.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal utilized various pre-set mechanisms in the mansion to commit crimes. These mechanisms included: spike traps hidden under the floor, poison needle launchers on the walls, heavy object release devices on the ceiling, automatic locking secret room systems, etc. The criminal carefully calculated the action route and time of each victim, ensuring they triggered specific mechanisms at specific moments. At the same time, the criminal also set up a series of false clues and misleading mechanisms to confuse the investigation direction. The entire crime plan demonstrated a high degree of foresight and precise control, with the criminal essentially "programming" the behavior and fate of the victims.

Key Clues: Conan noticed that although the manners of death varied, each victim had received specific information or instructions before death, guiding them to specific locations. At the same time, the mansion's power system and mechanism control panel showed signs of being manually manipulated.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The key to this case was to understand the entire mansion's mechanism system and control logic. Conan reconstructed the criminal's overall plan by analyzing the triggering conditions and operation methods of each mechanism. Finally, it was discovered that the criminal was the assistant of the mansion owner, who utilized his familiarity with the mansion's mechanisms and understanding of the owner's design thinking to transform this mechanism house into a precise killing device.

**Case Two: "Stars in the Water" (Special Optical Device Case)**

This case utilized special optical principles and devices to create a seemingly supernatural crime scene.

Case Background: A bizarre murder occurred in a lakeside town. The victim was found dead in a cabin by the lake, and witnesses claimed to have seen "moving stars" on the lake surface at the time of the incident, while only the victim was in the cabin. Local residents believed this was some kind of supernatural phenomenon or curse, adding a mysterious color to the case.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal utilized carefully designed optical devices and reflection systems to commit the crime. First, the criminal installed a waterproof strong light source at the bottom of the lake, connected to a timer. Second, multiple specially treated reflective objects were placed on the lake surface, which could move with the water flow while reflecting light. When the strong light source activated at a specific time, the light was guided to the cabin through these reflective objects, creating the illusion of "moving stars," attracting the attention of witnesses. Meanwhile, the criminal killed the victim through a pre-set mechanism in the cabin (possibly a hidden poison needle launcher or a timed toxic gas release device). Throughout the entire process, the criminal might have been far away, having a perfect alibi.

Key Clues: Conan noticed that the "moving stars" phenomenon was only visible at specific times and from specific angles, suggesting the possibility of human design. At the same time, remnants of batteries and wires were found at the bottom of the lake, confirming the existence of an artificial light source. In the cabin, a seemingly ordinary decoration was found to contain a precise mechanical device and poison residue.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The key to this case was to reveal the scientific principles behind the seemingly supernatural phenomenon and connect the scattered clues into a complete crime plan. Conan recreated the "moving stars" phenomenon through experiments, proving that it was a carefully designed optical illusion, aimed at diverting attention and providing cover for the real murder method. Finally, it was discovered that the criminal was a former magician with in-depth research on optics and mechanics, who utilized his professional knowledge to plan this seemingly impossible crime.

**Case Three: "The Disappearing Weapon" (Special Material Case)**

This case utilized the physical properties of special materials to create a puzzle of a "disappearing weapon."

Case Background: A wealthy businessman was stabbed to death in his study, but no weapon could be found at the scene. The doors and windows of the room were all locked from the inside, and no one could enter or exit. When the police broke down the door, they only found the victim's corpse and a puddle of water, with no possible weapon.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal utilized a special material—ice—to make the weapon. Specifically, the criminal poured water into a specially made mold to create an ice knife. This ice knife was hard and sharp enough to cause fatal damage but would gradually melt after use, eventually leaving only a puddle of water, eliminating the weapon as evidence. The criminal might have attacked at the moment the victim opened the door, then quickly left and locked the door from the outside (possibly using a special locking device or technique), creating what appeared to be a locked room.

Key Clues: Conan noticed that the distribution of water on the floor was unnatural, not like ordinary splashing or leakage. At the same time, the characteristics of the wounds on the corpse indicated that the weapon was a substance that was hard but would deform. In the room's air conditioning settings, traces of being set to an extremely low temperature were found, which might have been to slow down the melting speed of the ice weapon.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The key to this case was to identify the use of special materials and understand their physical properties. Conan proved through experiments that under specific conditions, ice could be made into a hard and sharp enough weapon to cause damage consistent with the wounds at the scene, then melt and disappear in a short time. Finally, it was discovered that the criminal was an artist with research in materials science, who utilized his professional knowledge to plan this "perfect crime."

**Case Four: "The Sound Trap" (Acoustic Weapon Case)**

This case utilized acoustic principles and special acoustic devices to create an invisible "sound weapon."

Case Background: A music producer suddenly died in his recording studio, the cause of death being ruptured internal organs, but with no visible injuries on the body surface. The studio's surveillance showed that no one entered or left at the time of death, and the victim did not come into contact with any potentially dangerous items.

Crime Method Analysis: The criminal utilized acoustic principles, especially the physical effects of infrasound (low-frequency sound waves inaudible to human ears) to commit the crime. Specifically, the criminal planted a special infrasound generator in the recording studio's sound system, set to activate at a specific time. When the system activated, the high-intensity infrasound created resonance under the specific structure of the recording studio, causing fatal damage to the internal organs of a person in a specific position. Since infrasound is inaudible to human ears, the victim might have been completely unaware of the danger before death.

Key Clues: Conan noticed that some equipment in the recording studio showed unusual vibration marks. At the same time, a special audio file with an abnormal frequency range was found on the victim's computer. Most importantly, the structure and acoustic design of the recording studio had a special sound wave focusing effect, possibly amplifying the impact of sound waves at specific frequencies.

Key Points of Solving the Case: The key to this case was to understand the physical effects and potential harm of sound waves, especially infrasound. Conan proved through acoustic experiments and simulations that under specific conditions, infrasound could indeed cause fatal damage to the human body. Finally, it was discovered that the criminal was an acoustic engineer who utilized his professional knowledge and understanding of the acoustic characteristics of the recording studio to design this invisible "sound weapon."
