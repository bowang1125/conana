## 15. Conclusion

### 15.1 Evolution and Innovation of Crime Methods

Throughout the nearly thirty years of serialization of the "Detective Conan" series, crime methods have shown obvious trends of evolution and innovation, which not only reflect the development of author Gosho Aoyama's creative thinking but also echo the changes of the times and the elevation of reader expectations. By analyzing these evolutions, we can more deeply understand the reasoning charm and lasting vitality of the Conan series.

**Evolution from Simple to Complex**

The crime methods in the early Conan series were relatively simple and direct, mostly focusing on basic locked room murders, disguised suicides, or alibis. For example, early locked room cases mostly used basic door-locking methods or simple mechanisms, and crime motives were also relatively straightforward. As the story developed, crime methods gradually became more complex and multi-layered, integrating multiple elements and techniques.

This evolution from simple to complex can be observed from several aspects: first is the improvement of technical complexity, with tools and mechanisms in early cases being relatively basic, while later cases incorporated more high-tech elements and precision machinery; second is the deepening of psychological levels, with psychological induction in early cases being relatively simple, while later cases exhibited more complex psychological manipulation and multi-layered motives; third is the complexification of case structures, developing from a single criminal's single criminal act to multi-person collaborative serial crimes or compound crimes with multiple purposes.

This trend of complexification, on one hand, satisfies long-term readers' need for freshness and challenge, and on the other hand, reflects the evolution of real crimes and the complexification of social problems. However, it is worth noting that even in the most complex cases, the Conan series still adheres to the principle of "fair reasoning," ensuring that readers have the opportunity to deduce the truth through clues, which is the core value of orthodox reasoning works.

**Integration of Technological Elements**

With the development of technology, crime methods in the Conan series have increasingly incorporated modern technological elements. The application of technology in early cases was relatively limited, mostly focusing on basic mechanical devices or chemical reactions. In later cases, we can see more applications of advanced technologies, such as electronic surveillance systems, computer programs, biometric technologies, drones, etc.

For example, in "The Dimensional Sniper," criminals utilize electronic devices and remote control technology to commit crimes; in "The Scientific Investigation Exhibition," criminals use advanced sound wave technology to create auditory hallucinations; in "Zero the Enforcer," it involves the application of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology.

This integration of technological elements not only makes crime methods more diverse and modern but also reflects the duality of technology in real societyâ€”it can both benefit humanity and potentially be used for crime. The Conan series, through these cases, reminds readers to remain vigilant and thoughtful in an era of rapid technological development.

**Deepening of Psychological Elements**

The crime motives in the early Conan series were relatively direct, mostly focusing on basic motives such as revenge, interest, or jealousy. As the story developed, the portrayal of criminal psychology became more in-depth and complex, showing the multi-faceted and contradictory nature of humanity.

In later cases, we can see more psychological induction-type crimes, compound motive crimes, and crimes caused by psychological disorders. For example, the psychological induction suicide in "The Devil of the TV Station," the multiple identity manipulation in "The Black Organization's Conspiracy," the mental disorder crime in "The Silent Fifteen Minutes," etc.

This deepening of psychological elements has made the Conan series transcend mere "puzzle games" to become a medium for exploring human nature and social issues. Criminals are no longer simply "bad guys" but three-dimensional characters with complex backgrounds and psychological states, sometimes even arousing readers' sympathy and reflection.

**Reflection of Social Issues**

As the Conan series developed, crime methods and case backgrounds increasingly reflected real social issues and problems. Early cases mostly centered on personal grudges, while later cases more often involved social issues such as environmental pollution, technological ethics, judicial justice, media responsibility, etc.

For example, "The Conspiracy on the Horizon" involves marine pollution issues, "The Scientific Investigation Exhibition" explores the boundaries of technological ethics, "The Scarlet Bullet" reflects the defects of the judicial system, "The Scarlet Memory" discusses the responsibility and influence of media reporting.

Through these cases, the Conan series not only provides reasoning entertainment but also guides readers to think about various problems and challenges in real society. This social concern gives the work deeper meaning and value, transcending pure entertainment functions.

**Expansion of International Vision**

Early cases in the Conan series mostly occurred within Japan, with crime methods mostly reflecting Japanese culture and social background. As the story developed, case scenes gradually expanded to various parts of the world, with crime methods also incorporating more international elements and cultural characteristics.

For example, the British cultural elements in "The Fog of London," the American background in "The New York Case," the Las Vegas magic performance in "The Foreign Magician," the confrontation of multinational intelligence agencies in "The Darkest Nightmare," etc.

This expansion of international vision not only enriches the story background and the diversity of crime methods but also reflects the characteristics of crime in the era of globalization and the importance of international cooperation. Through these transnational cases, the Conan series demonstrates the universality of crime and justice, as well as reasoning thinking under different cultural backgrounds.

**Balance Between Innovation and Tradition**

In the evolution process of crime methods, the Conan series has always maintained a balance between innovation and tradition. On one hand, the author continuously introduces new crime methods and elements, maintaining the freshness and challenge of the work; on the other hand, he adheres to the core principles and traditions of detective literature, ensuring the orthodoxy and solvability of the work.

For example, even in the most innovative cases, the Conan series still follows the principle of "fair reasoning," ensuring that all key clues are shown to readers; even when incorporating science fiction elements, they are explained scientifically to conform to real-world logic; even when describing complex psychological states, they do not completely deviate from the basic principles of realistic psychology.

This balance allows the Conan series to continuously innovate and develop while maintaining the traditional charm of reasoning, satisfying the expectations of old readers while attracting the attention of a new generation of readers.

**Possibilities for Future Development**

With the rapid development of technology and constant social changes, there is still great space for innovation and development possibilities in the crime methods of the Conan series. There may be more crime methods involving cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, biotechnology, space exploration, etc., and there may also be more cases reflecting emerging social issues and global challenges.

At the same time, with the improvement of readers' reasoning levels and changes in expectations, crime methods may develop in the direction of becoming more complex, multi-layered, and psychological, providing deeper levels of reasoning challenges and thinking space.

In any case, as long as the balance between innovation and tradition is maintained, adhering to the core principle of "fair reasoning," the crime methods of the Conan series will continue to attract readers, maintaining its unique position and lasting charm in detective literature.

### 15.2 The Importance of Reasoning Elements in the Conan Series

Reasoning elements are the core soul of the "Detective Conan" series, not only constituting the basic framework of the story but also being the main source of attraction for readers and viewers. By analyzing the performance and role of reasoning elements in the Conan series, we can more deeply understand the success and lasting charm of this work.

**Display of Reasoning Process and Sense of Participation**

One of the biggest features of the Conan series is the detailed display of the reasoning process, not just revealing the results. In each case, readers can follow Conan's thinking, observe the scene, collect clues, analyze evidence, deduce conclusions, and finally reveal the truth. This full-process participation experience makes readers not just spectators of the story but also participants in the reasoning.

For example, in a typical case, readers will first see the initial state of the crime scene and various clues, then follow Conan to observe details (such as time of death, weapon characteristics, scene traces, etc.), followed by investigation of suspects and analysis of testimonies, and finally the unfolding of reasoning and revelation of truth. Throughout the process, readers have the opportunity to discover key clues before or at the same time as Conan, forming their own reasoning, and this sense of participation is the core charm of the Conan series.

This display of the reasoning process not only provides intellectual challenges and puzzle-solving fun but also cultivates readers' observation skills, logical thinking, and critical thinking abilities. Long-term readers of the Conan series often develop more detailed observation habits and more rigorous thinking methods, which is the unique educational value of detective literature.

**Adherence to the Principle of Fair Reasoning**

The Conan series adheres to the principle of "fair reasoning," that is, all key clues needed to solve the case are shown to readers, giving readers the opportunity to reach the correct conclusion through their own reasoning. This principle is the core standard of orthodox detective literature and an important guarantee of the Conan series as a detective work.

In practice, fair reasoning is manifested in the following aspects: first, key clues are clearly shown to readers through images or dialogue, rather than being hidden or added later; second, the reasoning process is based on reasonable logic and scientific principles, rather than supernatural powers or unexplainable intuition; third, the final answer gives reasonable explanations for all key clues, leaving no major doubts.

This principle of fair reasoning makes the Conan series a true "reasoning game," where readers can think along with the protagonist and even challenge themselves to solve the puzzle before the protagonist. This intellectual challenge is an important source of the lasting charm of the Conan series and a key quality that distinguishes it from general suspense dramas or action films.

**Use of Diverse Reasoning Methods**

The reasoning in the Conan series is not limited to a single method but integrates various reasoning techniques and thinking modes, demonstrating the diversity and flexibility of reasoning.

First is deductive reasoning, that is, deducing specific conclusions from general principles. For example, Conan deduces the time of death through the degree of blood drying, deduces the shooting position through ballistic analysis, deduces the type of poison through chemical reactions, etc. This reasoning based on scientific principles and logical rules is Conan's basic method for solving cases.

Second is inductive reasoning, that is, summarizing general patterns from multiple specific instances. For example, Conan deduces a serial killer's crime pattern by analyzing the common features of multiple cases; identifies the characteristics of liars by comparing the behavioral patterns of multiple suspects, etc. This reasoning from specific to general demonstrates Conan's analytical ability and experience accumulation.

Third is reverse thinking, that is, deducing causes from results or exploring essence from appearance. For example, Conan often uses a "reverse deduction" method to deduce the entire crime process from the crime result; or discovers deliberately concealed truths by questioning surface phenomena. This reverse thinking challenges conventional thinking and demonstrates the creative side of reasoning.

In addition, there are various reasoning methods such as analogical reasoning, elimination method, hypothesis testing, etc. The flexible use of these methods makes the reasoning process of the Conan series more rich and colorful, and more in line with the way complex problems are solved in reality.

**Combination of Reasoning and Human Nature**

The reasoning in the Conan series not only focuses on physical evidence and logical analysis but also deeply explores human nature and psychological factors, making the reasoning process more three-dimensional and profound.

In many cases, understanding the criminal's psychological state and motive is the key to solving the case. Conan not only needs to analyze "how" the crime was committed but also understand "why" the crime was committed, and this insight into human nature is often the turning point in solving the case. For example, in "The Moonlight Sonata Murder Case," understanding the pianist's psychology and musical background is the key to solving the puzzle; in "The Black Organization's Conspiracy," insight into the psychological weaknesses and internal contradictions of organization members is an important strategy for fighting against the organization.

This combination of reasoning and human nature makes the Conan series transcend a simple puzzle game to become a medium for exploring human nature and social issues. While enjoying the fun of reasoning, readers can also think about the complexity of human nature and the multi-faceted nature of society, which is the depth of the Conan series as a mature literary work.

**Connection Between Reasoning and Daily Life**

The reasoning elements in the Conan series exist not only in earth-shattering major cases but also permeate into small details of daily life, making reasoning close and practical.

In daily plots, Conan often uses reasoning to solve small puzzles in life, such as finding out which classmate is lying, deducing the location of lost items, identifying disguised identities, etc. Although these small reasonings do not involve life and death, they demonstrate the application value of reasoning thinking in daily life, making readers feel that reasoning is not only the patent of detectives but also a practical ability that everyone can cultivate.

At the same time, many criminal cases in the Conan series originate from contradictions and problems in daily life, such as family disputes, workplace competition, neighborhood conflicts, etc. This connection from daily life to crime reminds readers that tragedies often originate from daily problems that are not properly handled, and reasoning thinking is used not only for solving cases but also for preventing problems and resolving conflicts.

**Integration of Reasoning and Scientific Knowledge**
