## 9. Disguised Accidents

### 9.1 Common Methods of Disguised Accidents

Disguised accidents are another common crime method in the "Detective Conan" series, with the core characteristic being that criminals disguise murders as accidental incidents to mislead the investigation direction of detectives and police. This method not only conceals the true criminal facts but also provides the culprit with more possibilities to escape, as accidental deaths usually do not trigger murder investigations.

In the "Detective Conan" series, the main implementation methods of disguised accidents include:

First is disguising traffic accidents. The culprit may design a seemingly accidental traffic accident, such as manipulating the victim's vehicle to lose control, setting up obstacles on the road, or directly using a vehicle to hit the victim. The characteristic of this method is utilizing the high frequency and commonality of traffic accidents to make the death appear like an unfortunate accident.

Second is disguising falling accidents. The culprit may push the victim from a height, such as a cliff, rooftop, or steep stairs, making it seem like an accidental fall. Or, the culprit may kill the victim first, then place the corpse in a position that seems likely to have fallen. The characteristic of this method is utilizing gravity and the danger of heights to make the death appear like an accidental fall.

Third is disguising drowning accidents. The culprit may push the victim into water, or kill the victim first, then place the corpse in water, making it seem like an accidental drowning. The characteristic of this method is utilizing the danger of water and the commonality of drowning to make the death appear like an accidental drowning.

In addition, there are disguised fire accidents. The culprit may kill the victim first, then create a fire, causing the corpse to be burned or severely damaged, concealing traces of murder. Or, the culprit may directly create a fire, causing the victim to die in the fire. The characteristic of this method is utilizing the destructive nature of fire to make the death appear like an accidental fire.

There are also disguised household accidents. The culprit may design a scene that seems like a household accident, such as electric shock caused by electrical appliance failure, poisoning caused by gas leakage, or crushing caused by furniture collapse. The characteristic of this method is utilizing potential dangers in the home environment to make the death appear like a household accident.

The advantage of disguised accidents is that if successful, the case may be directly determined as an accidental incident and closed, allowing the culprit to completely escape legal sanctions; even if suspicions are raised, the initial direction of the investigation will be misled, giving the culprit more time. In addition, even if it is finally determined to be murder, proving that a specific suspect is the culprit will also be more difficult.

However, disguised accidents also have some inherent risks and limitations. First, accidental incidents usually have some typical characteristics and physical laws, and if the culprit does not know enough about these characteristics and laws, it is easy to leave traces that do not match accident characteristics. Second, forensic examination may find wound characteristics that do not match accidents, such as wound angle, force, or number. Third, the victim's behavioral patterns and environmental conditions may not match accidents, raising suspicions. Finally, the culprit may leave their own traces when arranging the scene, providing clues for detectives.

In the "Detective Conan" series, solving disguised accident cases usually requires detectives to have keen observation and rich knowledge of physics and forensics, able to discover inconsistencies at the scene and identify the true cause and manner of death. Conan and other detective characters usually reveal the murder truth behind disguised accidents by analyzing wound characteristics, scene traces, physical laws, the victim's behavioral patterns, etc.

### 9.2 Classic Disguised Accident Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic disguised accident cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Snow Mountain Villa Murder Case**

Case Background: In a villa isolated from the outside world on a snow mountain, a skier was found dead, the cause of death being a heavy blow to the head. It was initially judged that the victim accidentally hit a tree or rock while skiing, leading to accidental death.

Crime Method: The culprit disguised murder as a skiing accident. Specifically, the culprit may have first hit the victim's head with a blunt object, then placed the corpse on the ski slope, creating the illusion that the victim accidentally hit an object while skiing. The culprit may have also deliberately damaged the ski slope to make the accident seem more reasonable.

Key Clues: The characteristics of the victim's head wound, such as the shape, depth, and angle of the wound, may not match a skiing impact; traces on the ski slope, such as whether the victim's sliding trajectory is natural; the victim's skiing technique and experience, whether such a serious accident is possible.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan discovered that the characteristics of the victim's head wound did not match a skiing impact, but more like being directly hit by a blunt object by analyzing these clues; at the same time, traces on the ski slope also showed that the victim may have stopped sliding before death. These findings revealed the murder truth behind the disguised accident. This case demonstrates how to utilize the danger of a specific environment (snow mountain) and activity (skiing) to disguise murder as an accident.

**Case Two: The Tokyo Aquarium Murder Case**

Case Background: In an aquarium, a staff member was found dead in the shark tank, initially judged to be an accidental fall and shark attack. However, some details raised Conan's suspicions.

Crime Method: The culprit disguised murder as a work accident. Specifically, the culprit may have killed or knocked out the victim first, then thrown the corpse into the shark tank, using the shark attack to cover up traces of murder. The culprit may have also deliberately damaged the railing around the tank to make the accidental fall seem more reasonable.

Key Clues: The characteristics of the wounds on the victim's body, such as whether there are ante-mortem wounds or wounds that do not match a shark attack; traces of damage to the railing around the tank, whether they show human-caused damage; the victim's work habits and safety awareness, whether such a serious accident is possible.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan discovered that the victim had ante-mortem wounds, indicating that he was already injured before falling into the tank by analyzing these clues; at the same time, traces of damage to the railing showed human-caused damage, not accidental collision. These findings revealed the murder truth behind the disguised accident. This case demonstrates how to utilize the danger of a specific environment (aquarium) and dangerous factor (sharks) to disguise murder as an accident.

**Case Three: The Mountain Villa Fire Incident**

Case Background: In a villa isolated from the outside world in the mountains, a serious fire occurred, and a resident died in the fire. It was initially judged to be death caused by an accidental fire. However, some details raised Conan's suspicions.

Crime Method: The culprit disguised murder as a fire accident. Specifically, the culprit may have killed the victim first, then created a fire, causing the corpse to be burned or severely damaged, concealing traces of murder. The culprit may have used flammable substances to accelerate the fire, or damaged electrical equipment to create the illusion of an electrical fire.

Key Clues: The origin point and spread path of the fire, whether they match the characteristics of a natural fire; the state of the victim's corpse, whether there are ante-fire wounds; possible traces of accelerants in the fire scene; the position of the victim, whether it matches natural reactions in a fire (such as trying to escape).

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan discovered that the origin point and spread path of the fire did not match the characteristics of a natural fire, but more like arson by analyzing these clues; at the same time, there were ante-fire wounds on the victim's corpse, indicating that he was already dead before the fire; the position of the victim also did not match natural reactions in a fire, such as he did not try to escape. These findings revealed the murder truth behind the disguised accident. This case demonstrates how to utilize the destructive nature of fire to disguise murder as an accident.

**Case Four: The High-rise Apartment Fall Incident**

Case Background: In a high-rise apartment, a resident was found dead after falling from a balcony. It was initially judged to be an accidental fall or suicide. However, some details raised Conan's suspicions.

Crime Method: The culprit disguised murder as a falling accident. Specifically, the culprit may have pushed the victim off the balcony, or killed the victim first, then thrown the corpse from the balcony, creating the illusion of an accidental fall. The culprit may have also deliberately damaged the balcony railing to make the accidental fall seem more reasonable.

Key Clues: The characteristics of the wounds on the victim's body, such as whether there are ante-fall wounds; the state of the balcony railing, whether there are traces of human-caused damage; the victim's behavioral patterns and psychological state, whether an accidental fall or suicide is possible; the trajectory and landing point of the fall, whether they match the physical laws of a natural fall.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan discovered that the victim had ante-fall wounds, indicating that he was already injured before falling by analyzing these clues; at the same time, the trajectory and landing point of the fall did not match the physical laws of a natural fall, but more like being pushed or thrown. These findings revealed the murder truth behind the disguised accident. This case demonstrates how to utilize the danger of falling from a height to disguise murder as an accident.

These classic disguised accident cases showcase the diversity and innovation of disguised accident methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of physics, forensic knowledge, and detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of disguised accidents and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
