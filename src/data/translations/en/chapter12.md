**Case Four: "The Black Organization's Conspiracy" (Biochemical Weapon Development Case)**

This case reveals the Black Organization's scientific research activities and long-term plans, demonstrating the technological aspect of organized crime.

Case Background: A top biologist mysteriously died while working in the laboratory, seemingly an experimental accident on the surface. During the investigation, it was discovered that the deceased was researching a new type of biological agent, and his research notes and key samples were missing. Conan and the FBI suspected this was related to the Black Organization and began an in-depth investigation.

Crime Method Analysis: This case demonstrates the Black Organization's methods in the field of technological crime. The organization first obtained internal information from research institutions through internal personnel or hacking methods, confirming the value of the target research. Then, the organization dispatched professional personnel to infiltrate the research institution, possibly through forging identities or bribing internal personnel. After obtaining the research results, the organization carefully planned an "accidental incident," both eliminating the informant and covering up the fact that the research data was stolen. The entire process demonstrates the organization's professionalism and systematicness in intelligence collection, infiltration actions, and cleanup work.

Key Clues: Conan discovered inconsistencies by analyzing the laboratory's security records and the deceased's research journal, indicating that someone had already accessed the research data before the deceased's death.
