## 8. Poisoning

### 8.1 Common Poisons and Methods of Use

Poisoning is one of the more frequently occurring crime methods in the "Detective Conan" series, with the core characteristic being that criminals use various poisons to cause death without requiring direct physical contact or violent acts. The covert and indirect nature of this method makes it the first choice for many criminals, especially those who wish to avoid direct confrontation or leaving obvious traces.

In the "Detective Conan" series, common types of poisons and their methods of use mainly include the following:

First are cyanide-based poisons. This type of poison appears most frequently in the Conan series, including potassium cyanide, sodium cyanide, etc. Their characteristics are strong toxicity and rapid action, capable of causing death in a short time. The method of use is usually mixing them into food or drinks, and after ingestion, victims quickly show symptoms such as difficulty breathing, convulsions, loss of consciousness, etc., ultimately dying from respiratory failure. Cyanide has a distinct almond smell, but it may be masked in certain foods (such as desserts containing almonds).

Second are sedative and hypnotic drugs. These drugs include sleeping pills, sedatives, etc., which may not be lethal by themselves, but excessive use or mixing with substances like alcohol may lead to death. The method of use is usually mixing them into drinks or food, causing the victim to lose consciousness or mobility, then carrying out other criminal acts, such as disguising suicide, creating accidents, etc.

Third are plant toxins. These poisons come from poisonous plants in nature, such as aconite, datura, poison hemlock, etc. Their characteristics are natural origin, not easily suspected, and some plant toxins are difficult to detect under specific conditions. The method of use is usually extracting the toxic components from plants, then mixing them into food or drinks, or directly using plant parts containing toxins.

In addition, there are metal-based poisons, such as arsenic, lead, mercury, etc. The characteristic of these poisons is that they can be used in small doses over a long period, leading to chronic poisoning, with symptoms that may be mistaken for illness. The method of use is usually adding small doses of poison to the victim's food or medicine over a long period, causing their health to gradually deteriorate, ultimately leading to death.

In poisoning cases, the methods of poison delivery are also diverse:

Food poisoning is the most common method, where the culprit mixes poison into the victim's food, such as desserts, main dishes, seasonings, etc. The advantage of this method is that it is natural and not easily suspected, but the risk is that multiple people may share the food, leading to non-target individuals being poisoned.

Drink poisoning is also common, where the culprit dissolves poison in the victim's drink, such as coffee, tea, alcoholic beverages, etc. The advantage of this method is that poison is easily dissolved and concealed, but there is also a risk of harming others.

Contact poisons are a more covert method, where the culprit applies poison to items frequently touched by the victim, such as doorknobs, books, clothing, etc. When the victim touches these items, the poison is absorbed through the skin or accidentally ingested, leading to poisoning. The advantage of this method is that it does not require direct contact with the victim, but controlling the dosage and ensuring the target person makes contact is more difficult.

Inhalation poisons are another common method, where the culprit releases toxic gases in an enclosed space, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, etc., causing the victim to die from poisoning after inhalation. The advantage of this method is that it can poison multiple people simultaneously, but it is difficult to control the range and avoid self-poisoning.

In addition, there are injection-type poisons, where the culprit directly injects poison into the victim's body. The advantage of this method is that it is rapid and direct, but it requires approaching the victim and leaves obvious traces.

In the "Detective Conan" series, solving poisoning cases usually requires detectives to have rich toxicological knowledge and keen observation, able to deduce the fact of poisoning and the identity of the culprit from the victim's symptoms, death environment, and possible sources of poison. Conan and other detective characters usually reveal the truth of poisoning by analyzing the victim's symptoms, checking possible sources of poison, considering the culprit's motive and opportunity.

### 8.2 Classic Poisoning Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic poisoning cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Diplomat Murder Case**

Case Background: In a villa isolated from the outside world, a diplomat was found dead. The victim had a red dot on his neck, a poison needle was found nearby, and the cause of death was suffocation. The room was a locked room, with all doors and windows locked from the inside.

Crime Method: The culprit used a poison needle and sound masking. Specifically, when entering the room with others, the culprit took the opportunity to stab the poison needle into the victim's neck. To mask the painful sounds the victim might make, the culprit arranged for symphony music to be played in the room in advance and placed a stack of books to block the view of the victim's expression. The poison in the needle quickly caused the victim to die from suffocation, while the culprit left the room with the others.

Key Clues: The red dot on the victim's neck, the special arrangement of symphony music and books in the room, and the source and characteristics of the poison needle.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced how the culprit used the poison needle in front of everyone by analyzing these clues, revealing the truth of poisoning behind what seemed to be a locked room suicide. This case demonstrates how to use a special tool like a poison needle to carry out covert poisoning.

**Case Two: The Financial Company President Murder Case**

Case Background: A financial company president was found dead in his office, the cause of death being poisoning. The culprit had a perfect alibi at the time of the incident, seemingly impossible to commit the crime.

Crime Method: The culprit used a heat-activated poison. Specifically, the culprit applied a special poison to the gas stove frequently used by the victim. This poison was non-toxic at room temperature but would release deadly gas at high temperatures. When the victim used the gas stove to boil water, the poison was heated, releasing poison gas, causing death by poisoning.

Key Clues: Possible chemical traces on the gas stove, and the environmental conditions when the victim died (such as whether the gas stove was being used).

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced that the victim may have been poisoned while using the gas stove by observing the scene environment and the victim's daily habits. Further examination of the gas stove revealed traces of poison, revealing the mechanism of timed poisoning. This case demonstrates how to use heat activation mechanisms to create timed poisoning effects.

**Case Three: The Sigh of the Tide**

Case Background: A man was found dead, initially judged to be poisoned by a cyanide-type poison. There was no obvious source of poison at the scene, and the culprit seemed to have no opportunity to approach the victim.

Crime Method: The culprit used a contact poison. Specifically, the culprit may have applied a cyanide-type poison to items frequently touched by the victim, such as doorknobs, book covers, or clothing. When the victim touched these items, the poison was absorbed through the skin or accidentally ingested (such as licking fingers to turn pages), leading to death by poisoning.

Key Clues: Possible traces of poison on items touched by the victim, and the victim's behavior and sequence of touching items before death.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the possible source and contact method of the poison by analyzing the victim's behavior before death and the items they may have touched. This case demonstrates how to use contact poisons to carry out covert poisoning.

**Case Four: The Black Organization's Poison APTX4869**

Although not a specific case, APTX4869 is the most famous poison in the Conan series and deserves special analysis.

Background: APTX4869 is an experimental poison developed by the Black Organization, intended as an undetectable killing tool. However, in some rare cases (such as Shinichi Kudo and Ai Haibara), it does not cause death but shrinks the body back to a child state.

Characteristics: The characteristics of APTX4869 are that it is colorless and odorless, acts quickly, and usually leaves no detectable traces. It is designed as the "perfect poison," capable of making victims appear to die naturally, not raising suspicions.

Method of Use: Usually given to victims in pill form, or dissolved in drinks. Black Organization members like Gin and Vodka often use this poison to execute "traitors" or people who "know too much."

This fictional poison showcases the author's imagination of the "perfect crime tool," while also being the core driving force of the entire Conan series story, as one of the main goals of the protagonist Conan is to find the antidote to this poison and restore his original body.

These classic poisoning cases showcase the diversity and innovation of poisoning methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of toxicological knowledge and detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of poisoning and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
