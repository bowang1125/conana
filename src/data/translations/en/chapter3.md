## 3. Locked Room Murders

### 3.1 Impossible Entry Locked Rooms

Impossible entry locked rooms are one of the most common types of locked rooms in the "Detective Conan" series. Their core characteristic is that the victim is alone in a room locked from the inside, and the culprit seemingly cannot enter the room to commit the crime. The puzzle in these cases is explaining how the culprit entered a seemingly inaccessible space, or how they committed the crime without entering the room.

In impossible entry locked rooms, there are generally two common methods: one where the culprit actually entered the room but somehow made it a locked room again after the crime; and another where the culprit never entered the room but committed the crime from outside.

In the first scenario, the ways culprits enter rooms are diverse. For example, in "The Diplomat Murder Case," the culprit exploited a blind spot in people's thinking, creating an illusion that made people believe the room was a locked room. In reality, the culprit entered the room with others, committed the crime inside, and then left with the others. The key to this method is misdirection, making people overlook the possibility that the culprit could be among them.

Another example is "The Bathroom's Locked Room Case" (Episode 121), where the culprit used tape on the door to create the illusion of a locked room. After leaving the room, the culprit fixed the door from the outside with tape, making it appear as if it was locked from the inside. The key to this method is using simple tools and techniques to create the illusion that the room was locked from the inside.

In the second scenario, the methods for committing crimes without entering the room are even more diverse and innovative. For example, in "The Cursed Mask Laughs Coldly," the culprit used the window of an adjacent room and 200 masks as a medium to stab the victim in the room from outside the window. This method requires precise measurements and calculations to ensure the knife accurately hits the target.

Other examples include "The Spider Mansion's Trap" and "The Dark Night's Duke Murder Case," where the culprit used wind as a medium to commit the crime. These methods usually require specific environmental conditions and precise calculations, which are difficult to achieve in reality but create highly challenging puzzles in detective fiction.

Another common method of killing without entering the room is timed murder, such as in "The Financial Company President Murder Case," where the culprit applied poison to the gas stove, which was released when the victim used the stove, causing death by poisoning. The characteristic of this method is that the culprit can leave the scene before the crime occurs, creating a perfect alibi.

Solving impossible entry locked rooms usually requires careful observation of details at the scene, looking for possibly overlooked entry methods or the possibility of remote crime. In the Conan series, these locked rooms are usually solved by discovering inconsistencies at the scene, such as special marks on doors and windows, unusual items in the room, or the victim's special condition.

### 3.2 Impossible Exit Locked Rooms

Impossible exit locked rooms are another common type of locked room, with the core characteristic being that the culprit cannot leave the room after committing the crime, yet the room is locked. The puzzle in these cases is explaining how the culprit left a seemingly inescapable space after the crime while keeping the room sealed.

In impossible exit locked rooms, the most common method is using various tools and mechanisms to allow the culprit to lock the room after leaving. These tools mainly include strings, tape, or similar items used to operate locks or transport keys.

For example, in "The Woman from the Black Organization," the culprit used chess pieces and telephone recording tape as a string to transport the key. After locking the door from the outside, the culprit created a channel with string to transport the key into the room through gaps like the door crack. The ingenuity of this method is that the culprit not only created a locked room but also hid the key under a book, increasing the complexity of the locked room.

Another example is using tape to deal with non-automatic locking doors. In "The Dark Night's Duke Murder Case," the culprit used tape to lock a long metal lock from the outside. This method is relatively simple but easily leaves traces, requiring the culprit to handle it carefully to avoid detection.

Another method of creating impossible exit locked rooms is using timing devices. For example, in "Dracula's Villa Murder Case," the culprit used film projection tape and tape to create a locked room even though the culprit was in their own room at the time. The characteristic of this method is that the culprit can have a perfect alibi when the crime occurs, increasing the complexity of the case.

Besides using tools and mechanisms, some impossible exit locked rooms utilize unknown secret passages. Although this method is not common in the Conan series, it is widely used by culprits in similar detective works like "The Kindaichi Case Files" in "The Lucia Doll Murder Case." The weakness of this method is that once the secret passage is discovered, the locked room puzzle loses its meaning.

There is also a special situation where the victim has a special relationship with the culprit, causing the victim to try to help the culprit conceal the truth even after being injured. Although rare, this situation does exist in some cases, adding emotional complexity to the case.

Solving impossible exit locked rooms usually requires looking for traces of tools that might have been used to operate locks or transport keys, or discovering possible secret passages or other exits. In the Conan series, these locked rooms are usually solved by discovering subtle traces near doors and windows, such as friction marks from strings, tape residue, or unnatural locking states.

### 3.3 Impossible Approach Locked Rooms

Impossible approach locked rooms are a more special type of locked room, usually not considered traditional physical locked rooms, but "locked rooms in thought" created by witness testimonies. The core characteristic of these locked rooms is that there is only one path in and out of the scene, and this path is constantly monitored by someone, making it seem impossible for the culprit to approach the crime scene.

In the "Detective Conan" series, impossible approach locked rooms are relatively rare, but there are some classic cases. For example, the locked room in "Dracula's Villa Murder Case" can be considered half an impossible approach locked room, as the path in and out of the crime scene is monitored, making it seem impossible for the culprit to enter or leave the scene.

The common feature of these locked rooms is: there is only one path in and out of the scene, and this path is usually constantly monitored by one or two people. The key to solving these locked rooms is revealing how the culprit entered and exited the locked room without being discovered.

In these cases, the culprit is often the monitor themselves or someone associated with the monitor. For example, in Seiichi Morimura's "Tokyo Airport Murder Case," the culprit used the hotel room door to create a visual blind spot for the duty officer to enter and exit the room, and used their identity as the victim's daughter to have the victim lock the door from the inside, creating a double locked room of "impossible approach" and "impossible exit."

Solving impossible approach locked rooms usually requires questioning the reliability of witness testimonies or discovering loopholes in the monitoring. In the Conan series, these locked rooms are usually solved by finding contradictions in witness testimonies or proving that the monitoring was not as strict as the witness claimed.

### 3.4 Classic Locked Room Case Analysis

In the "Detective Conan" series, there are many classic locked room murder cases, each showcasing unique crime methods and reasoning processes. The following are detailed analyses of several representative cases:

**Case One: The Mist Goblin (Episodes 53-54)**

Case Background: The case occurred in a temple room by a waterfall. The victim was found hanging from the ceiling beam of the room, and the scene was a completely sealed space with all doors and windows locked from the inside.

Crime Method: The culprit used water flow to create a locked room. Specifically, the culprit used the high window of the room and the railing of the platform outside the room as inclined bases to lay boards, guiding river water into the room. The culprit and the corpse covered with oilcloth sat on a raft, floating to the ceiling of the room as the room filled with water, hanging the corpse on the ceiling beam, and then draining the water. The method of draining was to climb out through the skylight, make a hole in the wall from the outside, and use water pressure to automatically flush the water out of the room, along with wall fragments down the balcony.

Key Clues: No traces of the culprit dragging the corpse to the ceiling were found at the scene, which made people mistakenly believe that the victim climbed to the ceiling beam with the rope and committed suicide by hanging. But in fact, this was evidence that the culprit used water flow to send the corpse to the ceiling beam.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the culprit's method of creating a locked room using water flow by observing the water marks at the scene and the damage to the wall. This case demonstrates how to use natural forces (water flow) to create a seemingly impossible crime scene.

**Case Two: Dracula's Villa Murder (Episodes 91-92)**

Case Background: Mouri and his group accepted the commission of vampire novelist Tora Kura Daisuke to investigate his wife's affair and came to his villa. At the time of the incident, Tora Kura Daisuke was found nailed to a cross, with the room door and other windows locked from the inside, and the door crack sealed with rubber. The only entrance and exit was the floor-to-ceiling window, with messy footprints in the snow in front of the window.

Crime Method: The culprit entered and exited through the study's main door, then used a projector film reel to lock it, disguising it as a locked room entered and exited through the window. The culprit made wooden nails with oil paint smell in the collection room to mislead the detective. In fact, the culprit entered through the main door, knocked the victim unconscious and nailed him to the cross, then left through the main door, using the projector's film to lock the door, creating a locked room that seemed to be entered and exited through the window.

Key Clues: Conan smelled oil paint near the wooden nails in the collection room, but there were no oil paintings in the collection room; the footprints outside the study window were too messy, as if deliberately created; the use of the projector was also an important clue.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan revealed how the culprit created an illusion, directing attention to the window, while the truth was entering and exiting through the main door, by analyzing these inconsistent clues. This case demonstrates how to use people's thinking habits and visual illusions to create a locked room.

**Case Three: The Key in Water Locked Room Case (Episode 165)**

Case Background: An architecture student was found having committed suicide by cutting his wrist in the bathroom, the scene was a locked room with only a 15-centimeter ventilation window open, and the room was not lit. A key was floating on the water surface of a model in the room, and the walls, beam edges, and door lock were all covered with crayon.

Crime Method: The culprit used beetles to transport the key. Specifically, the culprit used the scent of female beetles to attract male beetles, tying the key to the beetle with a rope twisted from three strands of toilet paper. After the beetle crawled into the water, the key naturally fell onto the water surface. Then, the culprit used a mosquito lamp outside the ventilation window to make the beetle fly away, leaving no traces.

Key Clues: Traces of beetles in the room, and the puzzle of how the key could float on the water surface without sinking.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the culprit's method of creating a locked room using beetles by observing subtle traces at the scene and analyzing the principle of the floating key. This case demonstrates how to use biology (beetles) as a tool to create a seemingly impossible crime scene.

**Case Four: The Colorful Legend's Mansion in Water (Episodes 226-227)**

Case Background: The case occurred in a building in the center of a pool, the victim was hanging from the room's crossbeam, and the Japanese-style door and another floor-to-ceiling small door were both locked from the inside. The window was open a small crack, but there was a grid outside. There were the victim's bloodstains outside the floor-to-ceiling small door.

Crime Method: The culprit used a water wheel to pull ropes, creating a time difference and an alibi. Specifically, the culprit first killed the victim, then used ropes and the mechanism of the water wheel to hang the corpse. The water wheel had ropes wound around it, and there were rope friction marks on the edge of the wooden walkway, which were key clues.

Key Clues: The rope break was obviously cut by someone first and then worn off, there was sawdust on the scroll, and there were also friction marks near where the hanging rope was on the beam, all indicating that the corpse was dragged up by a rope.

Key Points of Solving the Case: Conan deduced the culprit's method of creating a locked room using a water wheel and ropes by analyzing these marks. This case demonstrates how to use mechanical devices (water wheel) to create a seemingly impossible crime scene.

These classic locked room cases showcase the diversity and innovation of locked room murder methods in the "Detective Conan" series. Each case has its unique design and solution method, reflecting the author's clever use of detective elements. By analyzing these cases, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles and characteristics of locked room murders and appreciate the charm of reasoning in them.
